# band-name-generator

This is a simple CLI project made in python as an assignment for the course of [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu

It takes in two inputs, the city the user grew up in, and their pet's name then concats the two strings together as a possible band name one could use.
